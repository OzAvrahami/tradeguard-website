              <p>It does not apply to third-party websites, brokers, trading platforms, or services that maintain their own privacy policies.</p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection number="3" title="Information We Collect">
              <h3>3.1 Information You Provide Directly</h3>
              <p>When you join the private beta, contact us, or otherwise communicate with TradeGuard, we may collect:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>your name;</li>
                <li>your email address;</li>
                <li>your trading platform;</li>
                <li>the content of messages you send to us; and</li>
                <li>other information you voluntarily provide.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You are not required to provide information through our forms, but we may be unable to respond to your request or provide beta access without the information requested.</p>

              <h3>3.2 Trading Account Information</h3>
              <p>If and when supported account integrations become available and you choose to connect an account, TradeGuard may process limited account information required to provide its monitoring and protection features.</p>
              <p>Depending on the integration, this may include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>trading-account identifiers;</li>
                <li>account status;</li>
                <li>account activity;</li>
                <li>positions;</li>
                <li>trade activity;</li>
                <li>profit and loss information;</li>
                <li>session-related account information; and</li>
                <li>other read-only information required to evaluate the protection rules you configure.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>TradeGuard is designed to request only the account information reasonably necessary for its monitoring and protection features.</p>

              <h3>3.3 OAuth Authorization Information</h3>
              <p>Where an integration uses OAuth, TradeGuard may process authorization tokens or similar credentials required to maintain the authorized connection.</p>
              <p>TradeGuard does <strong>not</strong> collect or store your Tradovate username or password when authentication is performed through the official OAuth authorization flow.</p>
              <p>OAuth tokens are not your trading-platform password but should still be treated as sensitive authorization credentials.</p>

              <h3>3.4 Technical and Security Information</h3>
              <p>When you access the website or Services, certain technical information may be processed automatically by TradeGuard or its infrastructure providers, such as:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>IP address;</li>
                <li>browser type;</li>
                <li>operating system;</li>
                <li>device information;</li>
                <li>timestamps;</li>
                <li>requested pages or endpoints;</li>
                <li>application errors;</li>
                <li>security events; and</li>
                <li>server or diagnostic logs.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We use this information only where reasonably necessary to operate, secure, troubleshoot, and improve the Services.</p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection number="4" title="How We Use Information">
              <p>We may use personal information to:</p>

            <LegalSection number="5" title="Legal Bases for Processing">
              <p>Where laws such as the GDPR or UK GDPR apply, our legal bases may include:</p>
              <h3>Consent</h3>
              <p>We may rely on your consent when you voluntarily:</p>

              <ul><li>place orders;</li><li>modify orders; or</li><li>cancel orders.</li></ul>
              <p>Authentication performed by Tradovate is governed by Tradovate&apos;s own terms and privacy practices.</p>

              <p>We do <strong>not sell personal information</strong>.</p>
              <p>We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising or similar advertising purposes.</p>
              <p>We may disclose information only where reasonably necessary to:</p>
              <h3>Service Providers</h3>
              <p>We may use hosting, infrastructure, email, security, database, or technical service providers that process information on our behalf.</p>
              <p>Such providers receive information only as reasonably necessary to perform the relevant service.</p>

            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection number="8" title="Cookies and Similar Technologies">
              <p>At this stage, TradeGuard does not use advertising cookies, behavioral advertising trackers, or advertising pixels.</p>
              <p>We also do not currently use third-party analytics for behavioral tracking.</p>
              <p>The website may use strictly necessary storage or similar technologies where required for:</p>
              <ul><li>core functionality;</li><li>security;</li><li>session operation; or</li><li>user-interface preferences.</li></ul>

            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection number="9" title="Data Retention">
              <p>We retain personal information only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this Policy or as required by applicable law.</p>
              <p>In general:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>private-beta and contact information may be retained for up to <strong>24 months after the last meaningful interaction</strong>, unless an ongoing relationship requires longer retention;</li>

                <li>account information is retained only to the extent required for TradeGuard functionality, security, troubleshooting, or legally required records;</li>
                <li>technical and security logs are retained for periods reasonably necessary for security, reliability, and troubleshooting.</li>
              </ul>

            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection number="10" title="International Data Transfers">
              <p>TradeGuard is operated from Israel and may use service providers located in Israel or other countries.</p>
              <p>This means personal information may be processed in a country other than the country where you live.</p>
              <p>Where applicable law requires safeguards for an international transfer of personal information, we will use legally recognized safeguards or another lawful transfer mechanism as required.</p>
            </LegalSection>

            <LegalSection number="11" title="Security">
              <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, alteration, or disclosure.</p>
              <p>Our security approach includes limiting access to information to what is reasonably necessary for the operation of the Services.</p>
              <p>However, no internet service, computer system, or storage system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.</p>
              <p>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own devices, trading-platform accounts, email accounts, and credentials.</p>
            </LegalSection>
